            This is a Magic Maze Game. There can be from 1 up to 4 players in a game.
            There are 49 rooms on the board and 1 additional room for shifting the changeable rows and columns (indicated with arrow). 
            Each room has maximum 1 treasure in it. 
            There are 24 cards where the treasure image is depicted.The cards will be evenly distributed among the players. 
            Each player is shown one card at a time. 
            And the goal of each player is to shift the arrow-signed rows and columns using the extra room to reach the room where treasure from their card is hidden.
            After, the second card is revealed and so on. 
            Winner is the player, who collects all the treasures from his cards and returns back to his starting point. Enjoy it!
